## Background
Over the past century, the global economy has experienced significant growth, leading to an increased number of goods and services being produced to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding human population. As a result of this economic growth, the natural world has had to deal with the destruction of habitats, pollution, climate change, and more â€” driving many species towards extinction. With this in mind, we found that the correlation between production and endangered species is very complex, and is a correlation that could help policymakers with certain environmental decisions. By researching this, we will see if this correlation is something more impactful than we thought. 

## Research Question

Our research question goes into the potential correlation between the rate of endangered species and worldwide production. This research question has a big impact on environmental issues and sustainability because, with the world's population projected to reach nearly 9.7 billion by 2050 (according to the International Monetary Fund), there is more pressure than ever to try and understand the impact worldwide production has on endangered species. Understanding this relationship is crucial for potentially developing conservation strategies that can help balance economic growth with environmental protection. By exploring this relationship, people can identify the key issues regarding worldwide production, and then develop policies to encourage more sustainable production practices and protect vulnerable species and ecosystems.

## Our Hypothesis

Our hypothesis for our research question is that as production levels increase, the rate of endangered species also increases. As a result, the hypothesis predicts that there is a direct and positive relationship between production levels and the rate of species loss. The testing and refinement of this hypothesis will require us to look at our data sources to attempt to understand the complex relationship between production and biodiversity loss. Our next steps are to clean the data in a way that will allow us to start visualizing and analyzing. Once cleaned, we intend to check over this with Ford Fishman to continue on with our project.
